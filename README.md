# Vintage Extended Support

## What about Vintageous?

Most of you won't have problem switching to [vintageous](https://github.com/guillermooo/Vintageous)

Stick to this one if you really can't get used to the subtle difference between the two (like me)

Also, I personally find Vintage integrates with Sublime better (well, it's from Sublime)

## Some differences
- `n` with selection
- `vw` or any `v(something)`
- add what you miss from vintage

## How to install

Via package control: install `VintageES` (not yet, when [this](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel/pull/4899) is merged)

--------------------

[Vintage](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/vintage.html) is a vi editing package for Sublime Text 3.
